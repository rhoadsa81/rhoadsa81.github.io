	          The idea to create a 3D printer started my senior year in high school, when a buddy of mine and I discussed quite thoroughly 
	          what it would take to build one. At the time it was just a thought, but the summer before my freshman year at The Ohio State
	          University I began construction.

	          Over time more and more parts of the printer were collected and inturn added. A majority of my knowledge on the construction
	          of the printer came from the 3D printing community located at <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page">RepRap</a>. The linear bearings were ordered from Mcmaster Carr, 
	          and the stepper motors from a seller on Amazon. It should be noted that the extruder base was made from an old Altoids Sour 
	          case. This Altoids case serves not only as a base for the extruder, but also as a heat sink so as the PLA plastic will not 
	          get to hot and thus loss its integrity.

	          To control the functions of the 3D printer, a Printrboard controller was purchased. The firmware behind the master piece is Marlin which is an 
	          open source firmware package to help control delta 3D printers. Marlin is for Arduino compatible setups which the Printrboard is.

	        The first movements of the printer can be seen below. It should be noted that a sharpie was used and a circle was attempted to be drawn.
	        The circle itself did not turn out in large part due to the fact that the sharpie got caught on the the base plate. This was adjusted in the firmware
	        to alleviate the problem. The first print, on the other hand, was a small callibration cube. Inital layers to the cube were whopper jawed, but over time 
	        the printer adjusted itself and fixed the issue. The only way to prevent this issue from occuring in the future is to increase the resolution of the arms holding the
	        extruder and making sure each of these arms are the exact same length. This is currently being actively pursued through the purchase of traxxas steel pushrods, which 
	        can be adjusted if need be to counter act any abnormalities.
