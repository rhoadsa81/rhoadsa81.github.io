	          The idea to create a 3D printer started my senior year in high school, when a buddy of mine and I discussed quite thoroughly 
	          what it would take to build one. At the time it was just a thought, but the summer before my freshman year at The Ohio State
	          University I began construction.

	          Over time more and more parts of the printer were collected and inturn added. A majority of my knowledge on the construction
	          of the printer came from the 3D printing community located at <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page">RepRap</a>. The linear bearings were ordered from Mcmaster Carr, 
	          and the stepper motors from a seller on Amazon. It should be noted that the extruder base was made from an old Altoids Sour 
	          case. This Altoids case serves not only as a base for the extruder, but also as a heat sink so as the PLA plastic will not 
	          get to hot and thus loss its integrity.

	          To control the functions of the 3D printer, a Printrboard controller was purchased. The firmware behind the master piece is Marlin which is an 
	          open source firmware package to help control delta 3D printers. Marlin is for Arduino compatible setups which the Printrboard is.

	        The first movements of the printer can be seen below. It should be noted that a sharpie was used and a circle was attempted to be drawn.
	        The circle itself did not turn out, in large part due to the sharpie not being perfectly parallel with the base
		of the printer. This was adjusted in the firmware to alleviate the problem. The first print, on the other hand, was a small callibration cube. Inital layers of the cube
		were whopper jawed, but over time 
	        the printer adjusted itself and fixed the issue. The only way to prevent this issue from occuring in the future is to increase the resolution of the arms holding the
	        extruder and making sure each of these arms are the exact same length.

		The arms holding the extruder where updated from wooden arms with magnetic spheres at the end of each arm,
			to aluminum arms with traxxas ball joints at each end of the arms. The hot end base was also
			updated through the use of legos and duct tape. Duct tape was used as a medium to 
			help distribute the heat from the hot end.

			Recently I have updated many parts of the printer in hopes of improving the overall print quality. I improved the 
			hotend base by using lego's, I improved some of the supports throughout the machine and I also switched g-code software from
			<a href="http://slic3r.org/">Slic3r</a> to <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software">Cura</a>. These three main 
			changes seemed to make a tremendous difference in print quality.

			With a new found confidence in my printing abilities, I began to print out parts that could potentially replace current
			parts. I am making a Replicator of sorts, for any SG-1 fans out there. A spacer that goes around the linear bearings and 
			the hotend base were the first to be printed as can be seen below. I was very impressed with the printers ability to print a radius
			such as that on the spacer.
