	          I am an Aeronautical Engineering major at The Ohio State University. I was born and raised in a small, southern Ohio farming town
	          known as Hillsboro. There I worked on my families farm for the entirity of my life, where I performed many feats of manual 
	          labor along with fixing a wide swath of farm mechinery.

	          I have previously worked for Wright Patterson Air Force Research Discovery Lab, located in Dayton, Ohio. I worked on two projects
	          there, these projects being RCI robot ( a remotely controlled bridge inspection robot) and Bl!nkware (a pair of smart glasses
	          to alert drivers whenever they become drowsy).

	          I am actively looking for an Internship for Summer 2016 and a Co-op position for Fall 2016.
