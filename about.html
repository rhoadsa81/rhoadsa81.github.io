	          I am an Aeronautical Engineering major at The Ohio State University. I was born and raised in a small, southern Ohio farming town
	          known as Hillsboro. There I worked on my families farm for the entirity of my life, where I performed many feats of manual 
	          labor along with fixing a wide swath of farm mechinery.
