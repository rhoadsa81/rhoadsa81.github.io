	         Shown below is the RCI (Remotely Controlled Inspection) Robot. This crawler was designed and created to assist
	         civil engineers in the bridge inspection process. RCI implements a Raspberry Pi 2 for not only control of the crawler, 
	         but to also transmit live video feed to the user. It does this by turning the Raspberry Pi into a router where the individual 
	         wishing to control the RCI Robot would then connect to its network.

	          It should be noted that this project was presented to numerous Air Force officals. Each one of these officals were skeptical 
	          as to whether the RCI Robot would actually be able to crawl along a bridge. It was at this time, when their skepticism at a maximum,
	          the video below was shown to them washing away any doubt about its abilities. 
	          <br>
	          <br>
	          The video demonstration shows the RCI Robot crawling inverted, horizontal and even vertically.
