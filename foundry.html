	          Harnessing fire has always been a passion of mankind. Harnessing the power to change metal into liquid has been one of mine.
	          The aluminum foundry I have created reaches temperatures well of 1200 degrees fahrenheit. The container that the foundry is made
	          out of is an old Hydrogen gas cannister. The walls are filled with a mixure of sand and plaster of paris creating an insulating layer 
	          which reflects the temperatures of the foundry back in on itself.

	          As it currently stands I have melted down just under 5 pounds of aluminum. My main source of aluminum has been pop cans. This source is not
	          pure aluminum, but rather magnesium and aluminum (the tops of aluminum cans are an alloy of aluminum and mangnesium for magnesium's strenth)

	          Every part of the foundry, excluding the plaster of paris, was found around the farm. This includes the hairdryer to
	          the welded crucible seen below. It should be noted that the crucible is made from steel.

	          The casting process is unique to say the least. I have gone with sand casting which is one of many ways to cast.
	          The first step in casting is to make "Green Sand". This is done by mixing two parts sand and one part bentonite clay.
	          A slight amount of Water is then applied to this mixture so as the sand will stay together when compressed.
