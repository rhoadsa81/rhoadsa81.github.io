	          Harnessing fire has always been a passion of mankind. Harnessing the power to change metal into liquid has been one of mine.
	          The aluminum foundary I have created reaches temperatures well of 1200 degrees fahrenheit. The container that the foundary is made
	          out of is an old Hydrogen gas cannister. The walls are filled with a mixure of sand and plaster of paris creating an insulating layer 
	          which reflects the temperatures of the foundary back in on itself.

	          As it currently stands I have melted down just under 5 pounds of aluminum. My main source of aluminum has been pop cans so the ingots
	          produced are not entirely aluminum, but rather part manganese due to the pop can lids having this material added for reinforcement.

	          Every part of the foundary, but the plaster of paris, was found around the farm. This includes the hairdryer("air source") to
	          the freshly welded crucible seen below. It should be noted that the crucible is made from steel.
